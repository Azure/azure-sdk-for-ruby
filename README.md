# Microsoft Azure SDK for Ruby
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby)

This project provides a Ruby package for Azure Service Management, which makes it easy to access and manage Microsoft Azure Services like Storage, Service Bus and Virtual Machines.
* **Azure Service Management (ASM) or Classic**: Supported by most existing Azure resources.

If you're looking for **Azure Resource Management (ARM)**, preview version of the Ruby SDK is available [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-ruby)

Information on Azure deployment models: [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-classic-rm/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-classic-rm/)

# Supported Ruby Versions

* Ruby 2+

Note: x64 Ruby for Windows is known to have some compatibility issues.

# Getting Started with Azure Service Management

## Install the rubygem package

You can install the azure rubygem package directly.

```bash
gem install azure
```
Azure storage is in its own azure-storage [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/azure-storage) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ruby)

## Setup Connection

You can use this SDK against the Microsoft Azure Services in the cloud, or against the local Storage Emulator if you are on Windows. Service Bus and Microsoft Azure Service Management emulation are not supported. Of course, to use the Microsoft Azure Services in the cloud, you need to first [create a Microsoft Azure account](http://www.azure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/). After that, you can get the information you need to configure Storage and Service Bus from the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

There are two ways you can set up the connections:

1. [via code](#via-code)
2. [via environment variables](#via-environment-variables)

<a name="via-code"></a>
### Via Code
* Against Microsoft Azure Services in the cloud

```ruby

  require "azure"

  Azure.storage_account_name = "<your azure storage account name>"
  Azure.storage_access_key   = "<your azure storage access key>"

  # Configure these 3 properties to use Service Bus
  Azure.sb_namespace         = "<your azure service bus namespace>"
  Azure.sb_access_key        = "<your azure service bus access key>"
  Azure.sb_issuer            = "<your azure service bus issuer>"

  # Configure these 3 properties to use Service Management. We support passwordless pfx & pem cert formats.
  Azure.management_certificate = "<path to your *.pem or *.pfx>"
  Azure.subscription_id        = "<your Subscriptionid>"

  # Configure a ca_cert.pem file if you are having issues with ssl peer verification
  Azure.ca_file = "./ca_file.pem"

  # Or create a specific instance of an Azure.client, which will inherit your default configuration settings.
  client = Azure.client(storage_account_name: "your account name", storage_access_key: "your access key")

```

* Against local Emulator (Windows Only)

```ruby

  require "azure"

  # Configure these 2 properties to use local Storage Emulator
  Azure.storage_account_name = "devstoreaccount1"
  Azure.storage_access_key   = "Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw=="

  Azure.storage_blob_host    = "http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1"
  Azure.storage_queue_host   = "http://127.0.0.1:10001/devstoreaccount1"
  Azure.storage_table_host   = "http://127.0.0.1:10002/devstoreaccount1"

  # For Azure Government make sure to provide the full URI to the endpoint
  # End point mapping at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-government-developer-guide/

  # Local Service Bus Emulator is not supported
  # Local Service Management emulation is not supported

```

# Usage

<a name="storage"></a>
## Storage

### Setup your Storage Credentials

```ruby

# Require the azure rubygem
require "azure"

# Add your default storage credentials
Azure.storage_account_name = "your account name"
Azure.storage_access_key = "your access key"

# Or create a specific instance of an Azure.client
client = Azure.client(storage_account_name: "your account name", storage_access_key: "your access key")

default_blobs = Azure.blobs     # uses the Azure.storage_account_name and Azure.storage_access_key

blobs = client.blobs            # uses the client.storage_account_name and client.storage_access_key

```
Azure storage is available its own azure-storage [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/azure-storage) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-ruby)

# API to configure virtual network from xml file that can be exported from management portal and customized to add or delete vnet
vnetxml = './customnetwork.xml'
vnet.set_network_configuration(vnetxml)

```

# Getting Started with Certificates

Currently the sdk supports *.pem or *.pfx (passwordless pfx) for service management operations. Following are the steps discussed on various cert operations.

## Get Started with Publish Settings

* To create a pfx from the publishsettings, simply download the publishsettings file for your subscription
[https://manage.windowsazure.com/publishsettings](https://manage.windowsazure.com/publishsettings/index?client=powershell). Make sure you have this gem installed and
 run `pfxer transform --in [path to your .publishsettings file]`. This will create a .pfx from your publish settings file which can
 be supplied as a cert parameter for Service Management Commands.

## Get Started with OpenSSL

* Using the following openssl commands to create a cert and upload to Azure Management
  * Generate public and private `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout cert.pem -out cert.pem`
  * Generate public .cer for Azure upload `openssl x509 -inform pem -in cert.pem -outform der -out mgmt.cer`
  * Upload the `mgmt.cer` to Azure Management through [https://management.azure.com](https://management.azure.com)
  * Use cert.pem as your cert parameter for Service Management Commands.

# Contribute Code or Provide Feedback

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Development Environment Setup

### Download Source Code

To get the source code of the SDK via **git** just type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby.git
cd ./azure-sdk-for-ruby
```
Run bundler to install all the gem dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Setup the Environment for Integration Tests

If you would like to run the integration test suite, you will need to setup environment variables which will be used
during the integration tests. These tests will use these credentials to run live tests against Azure with the provided
credentials (you will be charged for usage, so verify the clean up scripts did their job at the end of a test run).

The root of the project contains a .env_sample file. This dot file is a sample of the actual environment vars needed to
run the integration tests.

Do the following to prepare your environment for integration tests:

* Copy .env_sample to .env **relative to root of the project dir**
* Update .env with your credentials **.env is in the .gitignore, so should only reside locally**

Azure Service Management integration tests use VCR, so they are recorded and can be easily played back without
consuming any Azure live resources.

### Run Tests

You can use the following commands to run:

* All the tests: ``rake test``. **This will run integration tests if you have .env file or env vars setup**
* A specific suite of tests: ``rake test:unit``, ``rake test:integration``, ``rake test:integration:blob``, etc.
* one particular test file: ``ruby -I"lib:test" "<path of the test file>"``

To run VCR tests:
* Set the following environment variable ``INTEG_RECORDED = true``, then run ``rake test:recorded``

### Generate Documentation

Running the command ``yard`` will generate the API documentation in the `./doc` directory.

## Provide Feedback

If you encounter any bugs with the library please file an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/issues) section of the project.
