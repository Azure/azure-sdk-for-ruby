# Microsoft Azure SDK for Ruby
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby)

This project provides a Ruby package that makes it easy to access and manage Microsoft Azure Services like Storage, Service Bus and Virtual Machines.
All Azure resources support one or both of the following deployment models:
* **Azure Resource Management (ARM)**: Preview version of the Ruby SDK available.
* **Azure Service Management (ASM) or Classic**: Supported by most existing Azure resources. SDK documentation at

Additional info on Azure deployment models [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-classic-rm/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-classic-rm/)

# Getting Started with Azure Resource Manager Usage (Preview)

## Install the rubygem packages

You can install the azure rubygem packages directly.

```bash
gem install azure_mgmt_compute
gem install azure_mgmt_storage
gem install azure_mgmt_resources
gem install azure_mgmt_network
```

Or use them in your Gemfile.

```Ruby
gem 'azure_mgmt_storage'
gem 'azure_mgmt_compute'
gem 'azure_mgmt_resources'
gem 'azure_mgmt_network'
```

Be aware the Azure Resource Manager Ruby SDK is in preview and will likely have breaking interface changes in upcoming
releases.

### Authentication

The first step to using the SDK is authentication and permissions. For people unfamilar with Azure this may be one of
the more difficult concepts. For a reference on setting up a service principal from the command line see
[Authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager](http://aka.ms/cli-service-principal) or
[Unattended Authentication](http://aka.ms/auth-unattended). For a more robust explanation of authentication in Azure,
see [Developerâ€™s guide to auth with Azure Resource Manager API](http://aka.ms/arm-auth-dev-guide).

After creating the service principal, you should have three pieces of information, a client id (GUID), client secret
(string) and tenant id (GUID) or domain name (string).

### Getting Started Samples
The tests for the libraries should provide a good example of how to get started with the clients. You can also see the
readme for each of the libraries [Compute](resource_management/azure_mgmt_compute),
[Network](resource_management/azure_mgmt_network), [Storage](resource_management/azure_mgmt_storage), or [Resources](resource_management/azure_mgmt_resources).

# Contribute Code or Provide Feedback

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request


## Development Environment Setup

### Download Source Code

To get the source code of the SDK via **git** just type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ruby.git
cd ./azure-sdk-for-ruby
```
Move to the folder containing Gemfile
```bash
cd resource_management
```
or
```bash
cd service_management/azure
```
Then, run bundler to install all the gem dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

### Setup the Environment for Integration Tests

If you would like to run the integration test suite, you will need to setup environment variables which will be used
during the integration tests. These tests will use these credentials to run live tests against Azure with the provided
credentials (you will be charged for usage, so verify the clean up scripts did their job at the end of a test run).

The root of the project contains a .env_sample file. This dot file is a sample of the actual environment vars needed to
run the integration tests.

Do the following to prepare your environment for integration tests:

* Copy .env_sample to .env **relative to root of the project dir**
* Update .env with your credentials **.env is in the .gitignore, so should only reside locally**

Azure Service Management integration tests use VCR, so they are recorded and can be easily played back without
consuming any Azure live resources. ARM tests will be converted soon.

### Run Tests

You can use the following commands to run:

* All the tests: ``rake test``. **This will run integration tests if you have .env file or env vars setup**
* A specific suite of tests: ``rake test:unit``, ``rake test:integration``, ``rake test:integration:blob``, etc.
* one particular test file: ``ruby -I"lib:test" "<path of the test file>"``

To run ASM VCR tests:
* Set the following environment variable ``INTEG_RECORDED = true``, then run ``rake test:recorded``

### Generate Documentation

Running the command ``yard`` will generate the API documentation in the `./doc` directory.

## Provide Feedback
