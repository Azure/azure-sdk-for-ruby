## Important Announcement

As of February 2021, Azure Resource Management SDK for Ruby has entered a retirement phase and is no longer officially supported by Microsoft. 

We are committed to making critical security and bug fixes for libraries in this repo until December 31, 2021. If you have discovered any bugs or security issues, please feel free to open an issue on Github. Please note that we will not be able to process any new feature requests.

After that date, this repo will no longer be maintained. 

## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and security fix requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. For new issues, file your bug or security improvement as a new Issue.

## Microsoft Support Policy
