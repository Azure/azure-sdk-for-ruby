    # An Azure Batch task.

    # Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a
    # compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not
    # limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node
    # disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
    # independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if
    # the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation
    # may occur. Because of this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means
    # tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing
    # any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running
    # tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

      # variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you

      # @return [Array<ApplicationPackageReference>] A list of application
      # packages that the Batch service will deploy to the compute node before
      # running the command line. Application packages are downloaded and
      # deployed to a shared directory, not the task working directory.
      # Therefore, if a referenced package is already on the compute node, and
      # is up to date, then it is not re-downloaded; the existing copy on the
      # compute node is used. If a referenced application package cannot be
      # installed, for example because the package has been deleted or because
      # download failed, the task fails.

      # @return [AuthenticationTokenSettings] The settings for an
      # authentication token that the task can use to perform Batch service
      # operations. If this property is set, the Batch service provides the
      # task with an authentication token which can be used to authenticate
      # Batch service operations without requiring an account access key. The
      # token is provided via the AZ_BATCH_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN environment
      # variable. The operations that the task can carry out using the token
      # depend on the settings. For example, a task can request job permissions
      # in order to add other tasks to the job, or check the status of the job
      # or of other tasks under the job.
