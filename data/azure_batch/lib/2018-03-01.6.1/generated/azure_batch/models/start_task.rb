    # A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch
    # service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.

    # Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a
    # compute node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not
    # limited to) when an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node
    # disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are
    # independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if
    # the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation
    # may occur. Because of this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means
    # tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing
    # any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running
    # tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.

      # @return [String] The command line of the start task. The command line
      # does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of
      # shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to
      # take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the
      # command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
      # "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file
      # paths, it should use a relative path (relative to the task working
      # directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable
      # (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).

      # @return [TaskContainerSettings] The settings for the container under
      # which the start task runs. When this is specified, all directories
      # recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch
      # directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all task
      # environment variables are mapped into the container, and the task
      # command line is executed in the container.

      # @return [Array<ResourceFile>] A list of files that the Batch service
      # will download to the compute node before running the command line.
      # There is a maximum size for the list of resource files. When the max
      # size is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code
      # will be RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of
      # ResourceFiles must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip
      # files, Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Files listed under
      # this element are located in the task's working directory.

      # @return [Integer] The maximum number of times the task may be retried.
      # The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
      # this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
      # service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
      # For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up
      # to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count
      # is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry
      # count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

      # @return [Boolean] Whether the Batch service should wait for the start
      # task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0)
      # before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start
      # task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task
      # up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has
      # still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch
      # service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to
      # it. This condition can be detected via the node state and failure info
      # details. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task
      # to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the
      # compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the
      # start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node.
      # The default is false.
