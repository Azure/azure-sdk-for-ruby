      include MsRestAzure

      # @return [String] A string that uniquely identifies the job within the
      # account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters
      # including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64
      # characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is,
      # you may not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
      attr_accessor :id

      # @return [String] The display name for the job. The display name need
      # not be unique and can contain any Unicode characters up to a maximum
      # length of 1024.
      attr_accessor :display_name

      # @return [Integer] The priority of the job. Priority values can range
      # from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being
      # the highest priority. The default value is 0.
      attr_accessor :priority

      # @return [JobConstraints] The execution constraints for the job.
      attr_accessor :constraints

      # @return [JobManagerTask] Details of a Job Manager task to be launched
      # when the job is started. If the job does not specify a Job Manager
      # task, the user must explicitly add tasks to the job. If the job does
      # specify a Job Manager task, the Batch service creates the Job Manager
      # task when the job is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager
      # task before scheduling other tasks in the job. The Job Manager task's
      # typical purpose is to control and/or monitor job execution, for example
      # by deciding what additional tasks to run, determining when the work is
      # complete, etc. (However, a Job Manager task is not restricted to these
      # activities - it is a fully-fledged task in the system and perform
      # whatever actions are required for the job.) For example, a Job Manager
      # task might download a file specified as a parameter, analyze the
      # contents of that file and submit additional tasks based on those
      # contents.
      attr_accessor :job_manager_task

      # @return [JobPreparationTask] The Job Preparation task. If a job has a
      # Job Preparation task, the Batch service will run the Job Preparation
      # task on a compute node before starting any tasks of that job on that
      # compute node.
      attr_accessor :job_preparation_task

      # @return [JobReleaseTask] The Job Release task. A Job Release task
      # cannot be specified without also specifying a Job Preparation task for
      # the job. The Batch service runs the Job Release task on the compute
      # nodes that have run the Job Preparation task. The primary purpose of
      # the Job Release task is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the
      # Job Preparation task. Example activities include deleting local files,
      # or shutting down services that were started as part of job preparation.
      attr_accessor :job_release_task

      # @return [Array<EnvironmentSetting>] The list of common environment
      # variable settings. These environment variables are set for all tasks in
      # the job (including the Job Manager, Job Preparation and Job Release
      # tasks). Individual tasks can override an environment setting specified
      # here by specifying the same setting name with a different value.
      attr_accessor :common_environment_settings

      # @return [PoolInformation] The pool on which the Batch service runs the
      # job's tasks.
      attr_accessor :pool_info

      # @return [OnAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should take
      # when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. Note that if a
      # job contains no tasks, then all tasks are considered complete. This
      # option is therefore most commonly used with a Job Manager task; if you
      # want to use automatic job termination without a Job Manager, you should
      # initially set onAllTasksComplete to noaction and update the job
      # properties to set onAllTasksComplete to terminatejob once you have
      # finished adding tasks. The default is noaction. Possible values
      # include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
      attr_accessor :on_all_tasks_complete

      # @return [OnTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take when
      # any task in the job fails. A task is considered to have failed if has a
      # failureInfo. A failureInfo is set if the task completes with a non-zero
      # exit code after exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error
      # starting the task, for example due to a resource file download error.
      # The default is noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction',
      # 'performExitOptionsJobAction'
      attr_accessor :on_task_failure

      # @return [Array<MetadataItem>] A list of name-value pairs associated
      # with the job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning
      # to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.
      attr_accessor :metadata

      # @return [Boolean] Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on
      # each other. The default is false.
      attr_accessor :uses_task_dependencies
