      # @return [String] The ID of an existing pool. All the tasks of the job
      # will run on the specified pool. You must ensure that the pool
      # referenced by this property exists. If the pool does not exist at the
      # time the Batch service tries to schedule a job, no tasks for the job
      # will run until you create a pool with that id. Note that the Batch
      # service will not reject the job request; it will simply not run tasks
      # until the pool exists. You must specify either the pool ID or the auto
      # pool specification, but not both.
      attr_accessor :pool_id

      # @return [AutoPoolSpecification] Characteristics for a temporary 'auto
      # pool'. The Batch service will create this auto pool when the job is
      # submitted. If auto pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the job
      # to a completed state, and the pool creation error is set in the job's
      # scheduling error property. The Batch service manages the lifetime (both
      # creation and, unless keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto
      # pool. Any user actions that affect the lifetime of the auto pool while
      # the job is active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify
      # either the pool ID or the auto pool specification, but not both.
