      # which the file will be downloaded to, including the filename.

      # property is specified, filePath is optional and is the directory to
      # download the files to. In the case where filePath is used as a
      # directory, any directory structure already associated with the input
      # data will be retained in full and appended to the specified filePath
      # directory. The specified relative path cannot break out of the task's

      # will be downloaded to a Windows node. If this property is not specified
      # for a Linux node, then a default value of 0770 is applied to the file.
