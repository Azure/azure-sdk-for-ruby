      # @return [Duration] The maximum elapsed time that the job may run,
      # measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete
      # within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks
      # that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be
      # MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no
      # time limit on how long the job may run.

      # @return [Integer] The maximum number of times each task may be retried.
      # The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
      # this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch
      # service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit.
      # For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to
      # 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is
      # 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count
      # is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value
      # is 0 (no retries).
