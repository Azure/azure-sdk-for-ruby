      # @return [String] The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network
      # subnet which Compute Nodes running Tasks from the Job will join for the
      # duration of the Task. This will only work with a
      # VirtualMachineConfiguration Pool. The virtual network must be in the
      # same region and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified
      # subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number
      # of Compute Nodes which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to
      # the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
      # service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      # Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that
      # Azure Batch service can schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be
      # verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network
      # Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified
      # subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state
      # of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form
      # /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
      # If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG),
      # then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound
      # communication from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a
      # Virtual Machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as
      # port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required
      # to be open for outbound connections for communications to Azure
      # Storage. For more details see:
