      # @return [Duration] The maximum elapsed time that the Task may run,
      # measured from the time the Task starts. If the Task does not complete
      # within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not
      # specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may run.

      # @return [Duration] The minimum time to retain the Task directory on the
      # Compute Node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After
      # this time, the Batch service may delete the Task directory and all its
      # contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be
      # retained for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or the Job is
      # deleted.
      attr_accessor :retention_time

      # @return [Integer] The maximum number of times the Task may be retried.
      # The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that
      # this value specifically controls the number of retries for the Task
      # executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the
      # Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
      # maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one
      # initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch
      # service does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum
      # retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
