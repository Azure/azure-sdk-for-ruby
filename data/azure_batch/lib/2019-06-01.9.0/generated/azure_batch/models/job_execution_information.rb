      # @return [String] The ID of the Pool to which this Job is assigned. This
      # element contains the actual Pool where the Job is assigned. When you
      # get Job details from the service, they also contain a poolInfo element,
      # which contains the Pool configuration data from when the Job was added
      # or updated. That poolInfo element may also contain a poolId element. If
      # it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does not, it means the Job ran
      # on an auto Pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto Pool.

      # @return [JobSchedulingError] Details of any error encountered by the
      # service in starting the Job. This property is not set if there was no
      # error starting the Job.
      attr_accessor :scheduling_error

      # @return [String] A string describing the reason the Job ended. This
      # property is set only if the Job is in the completed state. If the Batch
      # service terminates the Job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete -
      # the Job Manager Task completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to
      # true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the Job reached its maxWallClockTime
      # constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the Job ran as part of a schedule,
      # and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the Job's
      # onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminatejob, and all Tasks in
      # the Job are complete. TaskFailed - the Job's onTaskFailure attribute is
      # set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a Task in the Job failed with
      # an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminatejob. Any other
      # string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the 'Terminate a
      # Job' operation.
