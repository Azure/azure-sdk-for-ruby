      # @return [DateTime] The time at which the Task started running.
      # 'Running' corresponds to the running state, so if the Task specifies
      # resource files or Packages, then the start time reflects the time at
      # which the Task started downloading or deploying these. If the Task has
      # been restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at which the
      # Task started running. This property is present only for Tasks that are
      # in the running or completed state.
      attr_accessor :start_time

      # @return [DateTime] The time at which the Task completed. This property
      # is set only if the Task is in the Completed state.
      attr_accessor :end_time

      # @return [Integer] The exit code of the program specified on the Task
      # command line. This property is set only if the Task is in the completed
      # state. In general, the exit code for a process reflects the specific
      # convention implemented by the application developer for that process.
      # If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure
      # that you know the exit code convention used by the application process.
      # However, if the Batch service terminates the Task (due to timeout, or
      # user termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined
      # exit code.
      attr_accessor :exit_code

      # @return [TaskContainerExecutionInformation] Information about the
      # container under which the Task is executing. This property is set only
      # if the Task runs in a container context.
      attr_accessor :container_info

      # @return [TaskFailureInformation] Information describing the Task
      # failure, if any. This property is set only if the Task is in the
      # completed state and encountered a failure.
      attr_accessor :failure_info

      # @return [Integer] The number of times the Task has been retried by the
      # Batch service. Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are
      # retried, pre-processing errors (the Task could not be run) and file
      # upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the Task up
      # to the limit specified by the constraints.
      attr_accessor :retry_count

      # @return [DateTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the Task
      # started running. This element is present only if the Task was retried
      # (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is typically the same as
      # startTime, but may be different if the Task has been restarted for
      # reasons other than retry; for example, if the Compute Node was rebooted
      # during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the lastRetryTime is
      # not.
      attr_accessor :last_retry_time

      # @return [Integer] The number of times the Task has been requeued by the
      # Batch service as the result of a user request. When the user removes
      # Compute Nodes from a Pool (by resizing/shrinking the pool) or when the
      # Job is being disabled, the user can specify that running Tasks on the
      # Compute Nodes be requeued for execution. This count tracks how many
      # times the Task has been requeued for these reasons.
      attr_accessor :requeue_count

      # @return [DateTime] The most recent time at which the Task has been
      # requeued by the Batch service as the result of a user request. This
      # property is set only if the requeueCount is nonzero.
      attr_accessor :last_requeue_time

      # @return [TaskExecutionResult] The result of the Task execution. If the
      # value is 'failed', then the details of the failure can be found in the
      # failureInfo property. Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
