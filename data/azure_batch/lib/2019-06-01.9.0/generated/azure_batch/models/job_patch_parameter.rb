      # from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged
      # automatic Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to
      # do this, the request fails with an 'invalid property value' error

      # Job's Tasks. You may change the Pool for a Job only when the Job is
      # disabled. The Patch Job call will fail if you include the poolInfo
      # element and the Job is not disabled. If you specify an
      # autoPoolSpecification specification in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive
      # property can be updated, and then only if the auto Pool has a
      # poolLifetimeOption of Job. If omitted, the Job continues to run on its
      # current Pool.
