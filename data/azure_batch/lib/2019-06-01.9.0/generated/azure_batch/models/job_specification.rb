      # Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the
      # lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value
      # is 0. This priority is used as the default for all Jobs under the Job
      # Schedule. You can update a Job's priority after it has been created
      # using by using the update Job API.

      # @return [OnAllTasksComplete] The action the Batch service should take
      # when all Tasks in a Job created under this schedule are in the
      # completed state. Note that if a Job contains no Tasks, then all Tasks
      # are considered complete. This option is therefore most commonly used
      # with a Job Manager task; if you want to use automatic Job termination
      # without a Job Manager, you should initially set onAllTasksComplete to
      # noaction and update the Job properties to set onAllTasksComplete to
      # terminatejob once you have finished adding Tasks. The default is
      # noaction. Possible values include: 'noAction', 'terminateJob'
      attr_accessor :on_all_tasks_complete

      # @return [OnTaskFailure] The action the Batch service should take when
      # any Task fails in a Job created under this schedule. A Task is

      # failureInfo is set if the Task completes with a non-zero exit code
      # after exhausting its retry count, or if there was an error starting the
      # Task, for example due to a resource file download error. The default is

      # @return [JobManagerTask] The details of a Job Manager Task to be
      # launched when a Job is started under this schedule. If the Job does not
      # specify a Job Manager Task, the user must explicitly add Tasks to the
      # Job using the Task API. If the Job does specify a Job Manager Task, the

      # will try to schedule the Job Manager Task before scheduling other Tasks
      # in the Job.

      # Tasks of that Job on that Compute Node.

      # @return [JobReleaseTask] The Job Release Task for Jobs created under
      # this schedule. The primary purpose of the Job Release Task is to undo
      # changes to Nodes made by the Job Preparation Task. Example activities
      # include deleting local files, or shutting down services that were
      # started as part of Job preparation. A Job Release Task cannot be
      # specified without also specifying a Job Preparation Task for the Job.

      # have run the Job Preparation Task.

      # variable settings. These environment variables are set for all Tasks in
      # Jobs created under this schedule (including the Job Manager, Job
      # Preparation and Job Release Tasks). Individual Tasks can override an
      # environment setting specified here by specifying the same setting name
      # with a different value.

      # Tasks of Jobs created under this schedule.
