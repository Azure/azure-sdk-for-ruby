      # @return [String] The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network
      # subnet which the Compute Nodes of the Pool will join. This is of the
      # form
      # /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
      # The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      # Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      # addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If
      # the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will
      # partially allocate Nodes, and a resize error will occur. The
      # 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual
      # Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the
      # specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the
      # Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can
      # be verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated
      # Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the
      # specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set
      # the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with
      # virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
      # ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks') are supported, but for Pools
      # created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual
      # networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated
      # Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be
      # enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a virtual
      # machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22
      # for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud
      # service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also
      # enable outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more
      # details see:
