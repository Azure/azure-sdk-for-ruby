      # @return [String] The ID of an existing Pool. All the Tasks of the Job
      # will run on the specified Pool. You must ensure that the Pool
      # referenced by this property exists. If the Pool does not exist at the
      # time the Batch service tries to schedule a Job, no Tasks for the Job
      # will run until you create a Pool with that id. Note that the Batch
      # service will not reject the Job request; it will simply not run Tasks
      # until the Pool exists. You must specify either the Pool ID or the auto
      # Pool specification, but not both.

      # @return [AutoPoolSpecification] Characteristics for a temporary 'auto
      # pool'. The Batch service will create this auto Pool when the Job is
      # submitted. If auto Pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the Job
      # to a completed state, and the Pool creation error is set in the Job's
      # scheduling error property. The Batch service manages the lifetime (both
      # creation and, unless keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto
      # Pool. Any user actions that affect the lifetime of the auto Pool while
      # the Job is active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify
      # either the Pool ID or the auto Pool specification, but not both.
