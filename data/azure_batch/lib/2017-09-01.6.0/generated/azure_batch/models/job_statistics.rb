      # job during the given time range.

      # @return [Duration] The total wait time of all tasks in the job. The
      # wait time for a task is defined as the elapsed time between the
      # creation of the task and the start of task execution. (If the task is
      # retried due to failures, the wait time is the time to the most recent
      # task execution.) This value is only reported in the account lifetime
      # statistics; it is not included in the job statistics.
