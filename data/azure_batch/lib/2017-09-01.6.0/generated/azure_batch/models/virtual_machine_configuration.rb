      # @return [String] The SKU of the Batch node agent to be provisioned on
      # compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs
      # on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control
      # interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different
      # implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different
      # operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the
      # selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs
      # along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List
      # supported node agent SKUs' operation.

      # @return [WindowsConfiguration] Windows operating system settings on the
      # virtual machine. This property must not be specified if the
      # imageReference or osDisk property specifies a Linux OS image.
      attr_accessor :windows_configuration

      # @return [Array<DataDisk>] The configuration for data disks attached to
      # the compute nodes in the pool. This property must be specified if the
      # compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data disks attached to
      # them. This cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk (the disk is
      # not a file share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached
      # disk is empty. When the node is removed from the pool, the disk and all
      # data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted
      # after being attached, it must be formatted before use - for more
      # information see

      # deploying the operating system. This only applies to images that
      # contain the Windows operating system, and should only be used when you
      # hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which will be deployed.
      # If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is applied. Values are:
      #
      # Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
      # Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.

      # pool. If specified, setup is performed on each node in the pool to
      # allow tasks to run in containers. All regular tasks and job manager
      # tasks run on this pool must specify the containerSettings property, and
      # all other tasks may specify it.
