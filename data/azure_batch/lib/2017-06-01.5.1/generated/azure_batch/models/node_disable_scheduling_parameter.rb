      # @return [DisableComputeNodeSchedulingOption] What to do with currently
      # running tasks when disabling task scheduling on the compute node.
      # Values are:
      #
      # requeue - Terminate running task processes and requeue the tasks. The
      # tasks may run again on other compute nodes, or when task scheduling is
      # re-enabled on this node. Enter offline state as soon as tasks have been
      # terminated.
      # terminate - Terminate running tasks. The tasks will not run again.
      # Enter offline state as soon as tasks have been terminated.
      # taskcompletion - Allow currently running tasks to complete. Schedule no
      # new tasks while waiting. Enter offline state when all tasks have
      # completed.
      #
      # The default value is requeue. Possible values include: 'requeue',
      # 'terminate', 'taskCompletion'
