      #
      # requeue - Terminate running task processes and requeue the tasks. The
      # tasks will run again when a node is available. Reimage the node as soon
      # as tasks have been terminated.
      # terminate - Terminate running tasks. The tasks will not run again.
      # Reimage the node as soon as tasks have been terminated.
      # taskcompletion - Allow currently running tasks to complete. Schedule no
      # new tasks while waiting. Reimage the node when all tasks have
      # completed.
      # retaineddata - Allow currently running tasks to complete, then wait for
      # all task data retention periods to expire. Schedule no new tasks while
      # waiting. Reimage the node when all task retention periods have expired.
      #
      # The default value is requeue. Possible values include: 'requeue',
      # 'terminate', 'taskCompletion', 'retainedData'
