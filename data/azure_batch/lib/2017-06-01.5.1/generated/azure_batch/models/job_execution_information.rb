      # @return [String] The ID of the pool to which this job is assigned. This
      # element contains the actual pool where the job is assigned. When you
      # get job details from the service, they also contain a poolInfo element,
      # which contains the pool configuration data from when the job was added
      # or updated. That poolInfo element may also contain a poolId element. If
      # it does, the two IDs are the same. If it does not, it means the job ran
      # on an auto pool, and this property contains the ID of that auto pool.

      # @return [JobSchedulingError] Details of any error encountered by the
      # service in starting the job. This property is not set if there was no
      # error starting the job.
      attr_accessor :scheduling_error

      # @return [String] A string describing the reason the job ended. This
      # property is set only if the job is in the completed state. If the Batch
      # service terminates the job, it sets the reason as follows: JMComplete -
      # the Job Manager task completed, and killJobOnCompletion was set to
      # true. MaxWallClockTimeExpiry - the job reached its maxWallClockTime
      # constraint. TerminateJobSchedule - the job ran as part of a schedule,
      # and the schedule terminated. AllTasksComplete - the job's
      # onAllTasksComplete attribute is set to terminateJob, and all tasks in
      # the job are complete. TaskFailed - the job's onTaskFailure attribute is
      # set to performExitOptionsJobAction, and a task in the job failed with
      # an exit condition that specified a jobAction of terminateJob. Any other
      # string is a user-defined reason specified in a call to the 'Terminate a
      # job' operation.
