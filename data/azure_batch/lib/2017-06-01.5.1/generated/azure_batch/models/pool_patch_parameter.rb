      # @return [StartTask] A task to run on each compute node as it joins the
      # pool. The task runs when the node is added to the pool or when the node
      # is restarted. If this element is present, it overwrites any existing
      # start task. If omitted, any existing start task is left unchanged.

      # @return [Array<CertificateReference>] A list of certificates to be
      # installed on each compute node in the pool. If this element is present,
      # it replaces any existing certificate references configured on the pool.
      # If omitted, any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For
      # Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to
      # the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes,
      # the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working
      # directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is
      # supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with
      # visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the
      # user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates
      # are placed in that directory.
      attr_accessor :certificate_references

      # @return [Array<ApplicationPackageReference>] A list of application
      # packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to
      # application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the
      # pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool
      # until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it
      # replaces any existing application package references. If you specify an
      # empty collection, then all application package references are removed
      # from the pool. If omitted, any existing application package references
      # are left unchanged.
      attr_accessor :application_package_references

      # @return [Array<MetadataItem>] A list of name-value pairs associated
      # with the pool as metadata. If this element is present, it replaces any
      # existing metadata configured on the pool. If you specify an empty
      # collection, any metadata is removed from the pool. If omitted, any
      # existing metadata is left unchanged.
