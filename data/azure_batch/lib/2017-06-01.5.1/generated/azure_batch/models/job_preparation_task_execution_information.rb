      # @return [DateTime] The time at which the task started running. If the
      # task has been restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at
      # which the task started running.
      attr_accessor :start_time

      # @return [DateTime] The time at which the Job Preparation task
      # completed. This property is set only if the task is in the Completed
      # state.
      attr_accessor :end_time

      # @return [JobPreparationTaskState] The current state of the Job
      # Preparation task on the compute node. Values are:
      #
      # running - the task is currently running (including retrying).
      # completed - the task has exited with exit code 0, or the task has
      # exhausted its retry limit, or the Batch service was unable to start the
      # task due to task preparation errors (such as resource file download
      # failures). Possible values include: 'running', 'completed'
      attr_accessor :state

      # @return [String] The root directory of the Job Preparation task on the
      # compute node. You can use this path to retrieve files created by the
      # task, such as log files.
      attr_accessor :task_root_directory

      # @return [String] The URL to the root directory of the Job Preparation
      # task on the compute node.
      attr_accessor :task_root_directory_url

      # @return [Integer] The exit code of the program specified on the task
      # command line. This parameter is returned only if the task is in the
      # completed state. The exit code for a process reflects the specific
      # convention implemented by the application developer for that process.
      # If you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure
      # that you know the exit code convention used by the application process.

      # operating system, such as when a process is forcibly terminated.

      # @return [TaskFailureInformation] Information describing the task
      # failure, if any. This property is set only if the task is in the
      # completed state and encountered a failure.
      attr_accessor :failure_info

      # @return [Integer] The number of times the task has been retried by the
      # Batch service. Task application failures (non-zero exit code) are
      # retried, pre-processing errors (the task could not be run) and file
      # upload errors are not retried. The Batch service will retry the task up
      # to the limit specified by the constraints. Task application failures
      # (non-zero exit code) are retried, pre-processing errors (the task could
      # not be run) and file upload errors are not retried. The Batch service
      # will retry the task up to the limit specified by the constraints.
      attr_accessor :retry_count

      # @return [DateTime] The most recent time at which a retry of the Job
      # Preparation task started running. This property is set only if the task
      # was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present, this is typically
      # the same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been
      # restarted for reasons other than retry; for example, if the compute
      # node was rebooted during a retry, then the startTime is updated but the
      # lastRetryTime is not.
      attr_accessor :last_retry_time

      # @return [TaskExecutionResult] The result of the task execution. If the
      # value is 'failed', then the details of the failure can be found in the
      # failureInfo property. Possible values include: 'success', 'failure'
