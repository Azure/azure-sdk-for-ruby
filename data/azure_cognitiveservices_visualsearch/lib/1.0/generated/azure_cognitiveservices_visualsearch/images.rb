    # of preference. For additional information, including expected format, see
    # [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
    # header and the
    # [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#setlang)
    # query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this

    # [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#cc)
    # query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the
    # first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the cc
    # parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
    # finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an
    # aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market that
    # Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc query
    # parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
    # [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#mkt)
    # and
    # [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#setlang)
    # query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
    # in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
    # response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects

    # @param user_agent [String] The user agent originating the request. Bing uses
    # the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent
    # should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For
    # information about user agents, see [RFC

    # @param client_id [String] Bing uses this header to provide users with
    # consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
    # and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on
    # different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across
    # multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting
    # flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
    # inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
    # different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected.
    # Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s
    # search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses
    # this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity
    # generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality
    # of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through
    # rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider
    # this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for
    # the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
    # receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
    # better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your
    # application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If
    # you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and
    # returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you
    # should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses
    # your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that
    # your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist
    # the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is
    # used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
    # mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next
    # time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
    # persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the response
    # includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent
    # Bing requests for the user on that device. ATTENTION: You must ensure that
    # this Client ID is not linkable to any authenticatable user account
    # information. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include
    # cookies in the request.
    # @param client_ip [String] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The
    # IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
    # encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do
    # not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
    # Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
    # device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
    # @param location [String] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that
    # describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
    # content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the
    # keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
    # latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
    # than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values
    # indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes.
    # long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
    # longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to
    # +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values
    # indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which
    # specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned
    # by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,
    # 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
    # (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
    # (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
    # (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
    # direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
    # relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
    # (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
    # client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
    # device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
    # vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
    # the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
    # that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical
    # location. Providing the location is especially important if the client's IP
    # address does not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for
    # example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
    # this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should
    # include this header.
    # @param market [String] The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt
    # is the country where the user is making the request from. However, it could
    # be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
    # delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country
    # code>. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
    # possible market values, see [Market
    # Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
    # NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
    # the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal
    # response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
    # Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
    # Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject
    # to change.
    # @param safe_search [SafeSearch] Filter the image results in actions with type
    # 'VisualSearch' for adult content. The following are the possible filter
    # values. Off: May return images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return
    # images with adult content. Strict: Do not return images with adult content.
    # The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
    # policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
    # value and uses Strict. If you use the site: filter in the knowledge request,
    # there is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of
    # what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are
    # aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility
    # of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
    # @param set_lang [String] The language to use for user interface strings.
    # Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
    # the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
    # optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang
    # to the same language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user
    # interface strings displayed in a different language. A user interface string
    # is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
    # interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
    # properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
    # @param visual_search_request [String] The form data is a JSON object that
    # identifies the image using an insights token or URL to the image. The object
    # may also include an optional crop area that identifies an area of interest in
    # the image. The insights token and URL are mutually exclusive – do not specify
    # both. You may specify knowledgeRequest form data and image form data in the
    # same request only if knowledgeRequest form data specifies the cropArea field
    # only (it must not include an insights token or URL).
    # @param image The form data is an image binary. The Content-Disposition
    # header's name parameter must be set to "image". You must specify an image
    # binary if you do not use knowledgeRequest form data to specify the image; you
    # may not use both forms to specify an image. You may specify knowledgeRequest
    # form data and image form data in the same request only if knowledgeRequest
    # form data specifies the cropArea field only  (it must not include an insights
    # token or URL).
    # @param custom_headers [Hash{String => String}] A hash of custom headers that
    # will be added to the HTTP request.
    #

    # Visual Search API lets you discover insights about an image such as visually
    # similar images, shopping sources, and related searches. The API can also
    # perform text recognition, identify entities (people, places, things), return
    # other topical content for the user to explore, and more. For more
    # information, see [Visual Search
    # Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/overview).
    #
    # @param content_type [Enum] Must be set to multipart/form-data and include a
    # boundary parameter (for example, multipart/form-data; boundary=<boundary
    # string>). For more details, see [Content form types](
    # https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/overview#content-form-types).
    # Possible values include: 'multipart/form-data', 'application/json',
    # 'text/json', 'application/xml', 'text/xml',
    # 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    # @param accept_language [String] A comma-delimited list of one or more
    # languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing order
    # of preference. For additional information, including expected format, see
    # [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
    # header and the
    # [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#setlang)
    # query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set this
    # header, you must also specify the
    # [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#cc)
    # query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses the
    # first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with the cc
    # parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
    # finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it uses an
    # aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the market that
    # Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc query
    # parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise, use the
    # [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#mkt)
    # and
    # [setLang](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-visual-search-api-v7-reference#setlang)
    # query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
    # in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
    # response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
    # apply the specified language.
    # @param user_agent [String] The user agent originating the request. Bing uses
    # the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent
    # should be the same string that any commonly used browser sends. For
    # information about user agents, see [RFC
    # 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The following
    # are examples of user-agent strings. Windows Phone: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible;

    # @param client_id [String] Bing uses this header to provide users with
    # consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
    # and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on
    # different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across
    # multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting
    # flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
    # inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
    # different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected.
    # Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s
    # search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses
    # this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity
    # generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality
    # of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through
    # rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider
    # this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for
    # the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
    # receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
    # better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your
    # application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If
    # you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and
    # returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you
    # should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses
    # your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that
    # your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist
    # the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is
    # used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
    # mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next
    # time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
    # persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the response
    # includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent
    # Bing requests for the user on that device. ATTENTION: You must ensure that
    # this Client ID is not linkable to any authenticatable user account
    # information. If you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include
    # cookies in the request.
    # @param client_ip [String] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The
    # IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
    # encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do
    # not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
    # Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
    # device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
    # @param location [String] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that
    # describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
    # content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the
    # keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
    # latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
    # than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values
    # indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes.
    # long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
    # longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to
    # +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values
    # indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which
    # specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned
    # by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,
    # 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
    # (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
    # (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
    # (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
    # direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
    # relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
    # (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
    # client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
    # device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
    # vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
    # the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
    # that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical
    # location. Providing the location is especially important if the client's IP
    # address does not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for
    # example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
    # this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should
    # include this header.
    # @param market [String] The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt
    # is the country where the user is making the request from. However, it could
    # be a different country if the user is not located in a country where Bing
    # delivers results. The market must be in the form <language code>-<country
    # code>. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
    # possible market values, see [Market
    # Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets).
    # NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
    # the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal
    # response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
    # Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/bing-visual-search/supported-countries-markets),
    # Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is subject
    # to change.
    # @param safe_search [SafeSearch] Filter the image results in actions with type
    # 'VisualSearch' for adult content. The following are the possible filter
    # values. Off: May return images with adult content. Moderate: Do not return
    # images with adult content. Strict: Do not return images with adult content.
    # The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that Bing's adult
    # policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch
    # value and uses Strict. If you use the site: filter in the knowledge request,
    # there is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of
    # what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if you are
    # aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility
    # of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
    # @param set_lang [String] The language to use for user interface strings.
    # Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
    # the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
    # optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang
    # to the same language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user
    # interface strings displayed in a different language. A user interface string
    # is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
    # interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
    # properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
    # @param visual_search_request [String] The form data is a JSON object that
    # identifies the image using an insights token or URL to the image. The object
    # may also include an optional crop area that identifies an area of interest in
    # the image. The insights token and URL are mutually exclusive – do not specify
    # both. You may specify knowledgeRequest form data and image form data in the
    # same request only if knowledgeRequest form data specifies the cropArea field
    # only (it must not include an insights token or URL).
    # @param image The form data is an image binary. The Content-Disposition
    # header's name parameter must be set to "image". You must specify an image
    # binary if you do not use knowledgeRequest form data to specify the image; you
    # may not use both forms to specify an image. You may specify knowledgeRequest
    # form data and image form data in the same request only if knowledgeRequest
    # form data specifies the cropArea field only  (it must not include an insights
    # token or URL).
