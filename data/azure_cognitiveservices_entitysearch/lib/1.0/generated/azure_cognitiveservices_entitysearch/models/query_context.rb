      # @return [String] The query string used by Bing to perform the query.
      # Bing uses the altered query string if the original query string
      # contained spelling mistakes. For example, if the query string is
      # "saling downwind", the altered query string will be "sailing downwind".
      # This field is included only if the original query string contains a
      # spelling mistake.
      attr_accessor :altered_query

      # @return [String] The query string to use to force Bing to use the
      # original string. For example, if the query string is "saling downwind",
      # the override query string will be "+saling downwind". Remember to
      # encode the query string which results in "%2Bsaling+downwind". This
      # field is included only if the original query string contains a spelling
      # mistake.
      attr_accessor :alteration_override_query

      # @return [Boolean] A Boolean value that indicates whether the specified
      # query has adult intent. The value is true if the query has adult
      # intent; otherwise, false.
      attr_accessor :adult_intent

      # @return [Boolean] A Boolean value that indicates whether Bing requires
      # the user's location to provide accurate results. If you specified the
      # user's location by using the X-MSEdge-ClientIP and X-Search-Location
      # headers, you can ignore this field. For location aware queries, such as
      # "today's weather" or "restaurants near me" that need the user's
      # location to provide accurate results, this field is set to true. For
      # location aware queries that include the location (for example, "Seattle
      # weather"), this field is set to false. This field is also set to false
      # for queries that are not location aware, such as "best sellers".
