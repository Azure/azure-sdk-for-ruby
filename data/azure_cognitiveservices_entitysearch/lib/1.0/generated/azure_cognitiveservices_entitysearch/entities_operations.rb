  # restaurants, hotel, or other local businesses. For places, the query can
  # specify the name of the local business or it can ask for a list (for
  # example, restaurants near me). Entity results include persons, places, or
  # things. Place in this context is tourist attractions, states, countries,
  # etc.

    #
    # @param query [String] The user's search term.
    # @param accept_language [String] A comma-delimited list of one or more
    # languages to use for user interface strings. The list is in decreasing order
    # of preference. For additional information, including expected format, see
    # [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
    # header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify
    # both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc query parameter.
    # Bing will use the first supported language it finds from the list, and
    # combine that language with the cc parameter value to determine the market to
    # return results for. If the list does not include a supported language, Bing
    # will find the closest language and market that supports the request, and may
    # use an aggregated or default market for the results instead of a specified
    # one. You should use this header and the cc query parameter only if you
    # specify multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang
    # query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a label
    # in a user interface. There are very few user interface strings in the JSON
    # response objects. Any links in the response objects to Bing.com properties
    # will apply the specified language.
    # @param pragma [String] By default, Bing returns cached content, if available.
    # To prevent Bing from returning cached content, set the Pragma header to
    # no-cache (for example, Pragma: no-cache).
    # @param user_agent [String] The user agent originating the request. Bing uses
    # the user agent to provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
    # optional, you are strongly encouraged to always specify this header. The
    # user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used browser would
    # send. For information about user agents, see [RFC
    # 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html).
    # @param client_id [String] Bing uses this header to provide users with
    # consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features
    # and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on
    # different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across
    # multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting
    # flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an
    # inconsistent user experience. For example, if the second request has a
    # different flight assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected.
    # Also, Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client IDâ€™s
    # search history, providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses
    # this header to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity
    # generated by a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality
    # of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through
    # rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider
    # this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for
    # the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
    # receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
    # better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your
    # application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If
    # you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and
    # returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you
    # should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses
    # your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that
    # your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist
    # the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is
    # used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
    # mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next
    # time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
    # persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the response
    # includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent
    # Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
    # X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
    # @param client_ip [String] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The
    # IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
    # encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do
    # not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
    # Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
    # device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
    # @param location [String] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that
    # describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
    # content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the
    # keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
    # latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
    # than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values
    # indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes.
    # long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
    # longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to
    # +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values
    # indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which
    # specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned
    # by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,
    # 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
    # (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
    # (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
    # (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
    # direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
    # relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
    # (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
    # client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
    # device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
    # vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
    # the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
    # that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical
    # location. Providing the location is especially important if the client's IP
    # address does not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for
    # example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
    # this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should
    # include this header.
    # @param country_code [String] A 2-character country code of the country where
    # the results come from. This API supports only the United States market. If
    # you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
    # parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the
    # first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
    # language with the country code that you specify to determine the market to
    # return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported
    # language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the
    # request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
    # instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
    # Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
    # otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
    # parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do not specify
    # both.
    # @param market [String] The market where the results come from. You are
    # strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying the
    # market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal
    # response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do
    # not specify both.
    # @param response_filter [Array<AnswerType>] A comma-delimited list of answers
    # to include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the
    # response includes all search answers for which there's relevant data.
    # @param response_format [Array<ResponseFormat>] The media type to use for the
    # response. The following are the possible case-insensitive values: JSON,
    # JSONLD. The default is JSON. If you specify JSONLD, the response body
    # includes JSON-LD objects that contain the search results.
    # @param safe_search [SafeSearch] A filter used to filter adult content. Off:
    # Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages
    # with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return
    # webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the
    # request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch
    # is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you
    # use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may
    # contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is
    # set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your
    # scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include:
    # 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
    # @param set_lang [String] The language to use for user interface strings.
    # Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
    # the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
    # optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang
    # to the same language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user
    # interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter and the
    # Accept-Language header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user
    # interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
    # There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
    # links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified
    # language.
    # @param custom_headers [Hash{String => String}] A hash of custom headers that
    # will be added to the HTTP request.
    #
    # @return [SearchResponse] operation results.

    # rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider
    # this header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for
    # the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to
    # receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via
    # better quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your
    # application on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If
    # you do not include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and
    # returns it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you
    # should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user uses
    # your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that
    # your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist
    # the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is
    # used across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
    # mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next
    # time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
    # persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the response
    # includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent
    # Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
    # X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
    # @param client_ip [String] The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The
    # IP address is used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are
    # encouraged to always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do
    # not obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
    # Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
    # device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
    # @param location [String] A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that
    # describe the client's geographical location. Bing uses the location
    # information to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
    # content. Specify the key/value pair as <key>:<value>. The following are the
    # keys that you use to specify the user's location. lat (required): The
    # latitude of the client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater
    # than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values
    # indicate southern latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes.
    # long (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
    # longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to
    # +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and positive values
    # indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which
    # specifies the horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned
    # by the device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,
    # 380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
    # (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
    # (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
    # (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify the
    # direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
    # relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
    # (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
    # client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
    # device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the
    # vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify
    # the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information
    # that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although
    # optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's geographical
    # location. Providing the location is especially important if the client's IP
    # address does not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for
    # example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
    # this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you should
    # include this header.
    # @param country_code [String] A 2-character country code of the country where
    # the results come from. This API supports only the United States market. If
    # you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us. If you set this
    # parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the
    # first supported language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
    # language with the country code that you specify to determine the market to
    # return results for. If the languages list does not include a supported
    # language, Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the
    # request, or it may use an aggregated or default market for the results
    # instead of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
    # Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple languages;
    # otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This
    # parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do not specify
    # both.
    # @param market [String] The market where the results come from. You are
    # strongly encouraged to always specify the market, if known. Specifying the
    # market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and optimal
    # response. This parameter and the cc query parameter are mutually exclusiveâ€”do
    # not specify both.
    # @param response_filter [Array<AnswerType>] A comma-delimited list of answers
    # to include in the response. If you do not specify this parameter, the
    # response includes all search answers for which there's relevant data.
    # @param response_format [Array<ResponseFormat>] The media type to use for the
    # response. The following are the possible case-insensitive values: JSON,
    # JSONLD. The default is JSON. If you specify JSONLD, the response body
    # includes JSON-LD objects that contain the search results.
    # @param safe_search [SafeSearch] A filter used to filter adult content. Off:
    # Return webpages with adult text, images, or videos. Moderate: Return webpages
    # with adult text, but not adult images or videos. Strict: Do not return
    # webpages with adult text, images, or videos. The default is Moderate. If the
    # request comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch
    # is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you
    # use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may
    # contain adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is
    # set to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your
    # scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible values include:
    # 'Off', 'Moderate', 'Strict'
    # @param set_lang [String] The language to use for user interface strings.
    # Specify the language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
    # the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although
    # optional, you should always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang
    # to the same language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user
    # interface strings displayed in a different language. This parameter and the
    # Accept-Language header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user
    # interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user interface.
    # There are few user interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any
    # links to Bing.com properties in the response objects apply the specified
    # language.
    # @param [Hash{String => String}] A hash of custom headers that will be added
    # to the HTTP request.
    #
    # @return [Concurrent::Promise] Promise object which holds the HTTP response.
