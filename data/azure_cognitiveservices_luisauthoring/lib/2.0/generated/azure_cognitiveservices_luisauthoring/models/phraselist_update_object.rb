      # list. A non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the
      # list serve as separate features to the underlying training algorithm.
      # So, if you your phrase list feature contains 5 phrases, they will be
      # mapped to 5 separate features. You can think of the non-exchangeable
      # phrase list feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing

      # non-exchangeable as set of different words. Default value is true.
