      # @return [Boolean] An exchangeable phrase list feature are serves as
      # single feature to the LUIS underlying training algorithm. It is used as
      # a lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a
      # given word or 0 if it doesnâ€™t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms
      # list. A non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the
      # list serve as separate features to the underlying training algorithm.
      # So, if you your phrase list feature contains 5 phrases, they will be
      # mapped to 5 separate features. You can think of the non-exchangeable
      # phrase list feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing
      # to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. Think of a
      # non-exchangeable as set of different words. Default value is true.
