    # Sends a health report on a Service Fabric cluster. The report must contain
    # the information about the source of the health report and property on which
    # it is reported.
    # The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the
    # health store.
    # The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store
    # after extra validation.
    # For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid
    # parameter, like a stale sequence number.
    # To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run
    # GetClusterHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents
    # section.
    #
    # @param health_information [HealthInformation] Describes the health
    # information for the health report. This information needs to be present in
    # all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
    # @param immediate [Boolean] A flag which indicates whether the report should
    # be sent immediately.
    # A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which
    # forwards to the health store.
    # If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway
    # to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP
    # Gateway Application is using.
    # This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
    # Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail,
    # for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the
    # Gateway.
    # If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client
    # settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to
    # the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
    # This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to
    # optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report
    # processing.
    # By default, reports are not sent immediately.
    # @param timeout [Integer] The server timeout for performing the operation in
    # seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing
    # to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this
    # parameter is 60 seconds.
    # @param [Hash{String => String}] A hash of custom headers that will be added
    # to the HTTP request.
    #
    # @return [Concurrent::Promise] Promise object which holds the HTTP response.

    # Reports health state of the specified Service Fabric node. The report must
    # contain the information about the source of the health report and property on
    # which it is reported.
    # The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the
    # health store.
    # The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store
    # after extra validation.
    # For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid
    # parameter, like a stale sequence number.
    # To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetNodeHealth

    # be sent immediately.
    # A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which
    # forwards to the health store.
    # If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway
    # to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP
    # Gateway Application is using.
    # This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
    # Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail,
    # for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the
    # Gateway.
    # If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client
    # settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to
    # the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
    # This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to
    # optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report
    # processing.

    # @param health_information [HealthInformation] Describes the health
    # information for the health report. This information needs to be present in
    # all of the health reports sent to the health manager.
    # @param immediate [Boolean] A flag which indicates whether the report should
    # be sent immediately.
    # A health report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway Application, which
    # forwards to the health store.
    # If Immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from HTTP Gateway
    # to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the HTTP
    # Gateway Application is using.
    # This is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible.
    # Depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail,
    # for example if the HTTP Gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the
    # Gateway.
    # If Immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client
    # settings from the HTTP Gateway. Therefore, it will be batched according to
    # the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.
    # This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to
    # optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report
    # processing.
    # By default, reports are not sent immediately.
    # @param timeout [Integer] The server timeout for performing the operation in
    # seconds. This timeout specifies the time duration that the client is willing
    # to wait for the requested operation to complete. The default value for this
    # parameter is 60 seconds.
    # @param [Hash{String => String}] A hash of custom headers that will be added
    # to the HTTP request.

    # - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
    # - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
    # return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
    # - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
    # - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The
    # value is 4.
    # - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value
    # is 8.
    # - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
    # 65535.
