      # @return [UpgradeMode] The mode used to monitor health during a rolling
      # upgrade. The values are UnmonitoredAuto, UnmonitoredManual, and
      # Monitored. Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'UnmonitoredAuto',
      # 'UnmonitoredManual', 'Monitored'. Default value: 'UnmonitoredAuto' .

      # during upgrade even when the code version has not changed (the upgrade
      # only changes configuration or data).
      attr_accessor :force_restart

      # @return [Integer] The maximum amount of time to block processing of an
      # upgrade domain and prevent loss of availability when there are
      # unexpected issues. When this timeout expires, processing of the upgrade
      # domain will proceed regardless of availability loss issues. The timeout
      # is reset at the start of each upgrade domain. Valid values are between
      # 0 and 42949672925 inclusive. (unsigned 32-bit integer).

      # @return [FailureAction] The compensating action to perform when a
      # Monitored upgrade encounters monitoring policy or health policy
      # violations.
      # Invalid indicates the failure action is invalid. Rollback specifies
      # that the upgrade will start rolling back automatically.
      # Manual indicates that the upgrade will switch to UnmonitoredManual
      # upgrade mode. Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'

      # domain before applying health policies. It is first interpreted as a

      # interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
      attr_accessor :health_check_wait_duration_in_milliseconds

      # @return [String] The amount of time that the application or cluster
      # must remain healthy before the upgrade proceeds to the next upgrade
      # domain. It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601
      # duration. If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number
      # representing the total number of milliseconds.

      # application or cluster is unhealthy before FailureAction is executed.
      # It is first interpreted as a string representing an ISO 8601 duration.
      # If that fails, then it is interpreted as a number representing the
      # total number of milliseconds.
      attr_accessor :health_check_retry_timeout_in_milliseconds

      # @return [String] The amount of time the overall upgrade has to complete
      # before FailureAction is executed. It is first interpreted as a string
      # representing an ISO 8601 duration. If that fails, then it is
      # interpreted as a number representing the total number of milliseconds.
