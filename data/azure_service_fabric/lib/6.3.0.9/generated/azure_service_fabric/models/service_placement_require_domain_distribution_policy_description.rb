    # Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
    # where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the
    # same fault or upgrade domain.
    #
    # While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk
    # of concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of
    # subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where
    # replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per
    # location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally
    # the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of
    # the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy
    # should be set.
