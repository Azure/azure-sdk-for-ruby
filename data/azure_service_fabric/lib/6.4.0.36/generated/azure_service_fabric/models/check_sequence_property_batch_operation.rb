    # Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber
    # argument.
    # A property's sequence number can be thought of as that property's
    # version.
    # Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased.
    # The sequence number can be found in a property's metadata.
    # The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.
    # CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition
    # for the write operations in the batch.
    # Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails,
    # the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.
