      # referenced campaign. All campaign's properties can be overridden except
      # for the following: `name`, `manualPush`, `audience`, `startTime` and
      # `timezone`. `endTime` can be overridden while keeping original
      # `timezone` parameter. The effect is to change the client side
      # expiration of the received campaign for the specific devices. If your
      # campaign is a *poll*, the provided data should contain the same number
      # of questions and choices that the one you created with the create
      # command. Please note that all the push messages created using this
      # parameter will expire after 4 weeks at maximum (`endTime` property of
      # the campaign will be used if lower than 4 weeks in the future).
