      # compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs
      # on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control
      # interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different
      # implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different
      # operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the
      # selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs
      # along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List
      # supported node agent SKUs' operation.

      # virtual machine. This property must not be specified if the
      # imageReference specifies a Linux OS image.

      # @return [Array<DataDisk>] The configuration for data disks attached to
      # the compute nodes in the pool. This property must be specified if the
      # compute nodes in the pool need to have empty data disks attached to
      # them.

      # @return [String] The type of on-premises license to be used when
      # deploying the operating system. This only applies to images that
      # contain the Windows operating system, and should only be used when you
      # hold valid on-premises licenses for the nodes which will be deployed.
      # If omitted, no on-premises licensing discount is applied. Values are:
      #
      # Windows_Server - The on-premises license is for Windows Server.
      # Windows_Client - The on-premises license is for Windows Client.
