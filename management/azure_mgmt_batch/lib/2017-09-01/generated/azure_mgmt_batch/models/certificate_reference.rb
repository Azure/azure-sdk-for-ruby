      # cloudServiceConfiguration, or with virtualMachineConfiguration using a
      # Windows image reference). For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are

      # to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of

      # directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed
      # in that directory. Possible values include: 'CurrentUser',

      # Windows image reference). Common store names include: My, Root, CA,

      # AddressBook, but any custom store name can also be used. The default
      # value is My.
