      # @return [String] The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network
      # subnet which the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of the
      # form
      # /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.
      # The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      # Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP
      # addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet
      # doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate
      # compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch'
      # service principal must have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'
      # Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The
      # specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service
      # to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified
      # by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security
      # Groups (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified
      # subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state
      # of the compute nodes to unusable. For pools created via
      # virtualMachineConfiguration the Batch account must have
      # poolAllocationMode userSubscription in order to use a VNet. If the
      # specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a
      # few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication.
      # For pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable ports
      # 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for
      # Windows. For pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable
      # ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to
      # Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:
