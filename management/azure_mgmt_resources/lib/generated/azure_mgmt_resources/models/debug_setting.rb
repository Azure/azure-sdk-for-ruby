      # debugging. The permitted values are none, requestContent,
      # responseContent, or both requestContent and responseContent separated
      # by a comma. The default is none. When setting this value, carefully
      # consider the type of information you are passing in during deployment.

      # potentially expose sensitive data that is retrieved through the
      # deployment operations.
