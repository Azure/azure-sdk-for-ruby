      # @return [String] Name of the API. The name of the operation being
      # performed on this particular object. It should match the action name
      # that appears in RBAC / the event service. Examples of operations
      # include: * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action *
      # Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action *
      # Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write *
      # Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read *
      # Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete Each action should include, in
      # order: (1) Resource Provider Namespace (2) Type hierarchy for which the
      # action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL Azure database) (3)
      # Read, Write, Action or Delete indicating which type applies. If it is a
      # PUT/PATCH on a collection or named value, Write should be used. If it
      # is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE, Delete should be
      # used. If it is a POST, Action should be used. As a note: all resource
      # providers would need to include the "{Resource Provider
      # Namespace}/register/action" operation in their response. This API is
      # used to register for their service, and should include details about
      # the operation (e.g. a localized name for the resource provider + any
      # special considerations like PII release)

      # governs the display of the operation in the RBAC UX and the audit logs
      # UX. Default value is "user,system"

      # @return Properties. Reserved for future use.
