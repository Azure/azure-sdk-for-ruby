      # action is in. Some commonly used states are: Active      -> recommended
      # action is active and no action has been taken yet. Pending     ->
      # recommended action is approved for and is awaiting execution. Executing
      # -> recommended action is being applied on the user database. Verifying
      # -> recommended action was applied and is being verified of its
      # usefulness by the system. Success     -> recommended action was applied
      # and improvement found during verification. Pending Revert  ->
      # verification found little or no improvement so recommended action is
      # queued for revert or user has manually reverted. Reverting   -> changes
      # made while applying recommended action are being reverted on the user
      # database. Reverted    -> succesfully reverted the changes made by
      # recommended action on user database. Ignored     -> user explicitly
      # ignored/discarded the recommended action. Possible values include:
      # 'Active', 'Pending', 'Executing', 'Verifying', 'PendingRevert',
      # 'RevertCancelled', 'Reverting', 'Reverted', 'Ignored', 'Expired',
      # 'Monitoring', 'Resolved', 'Success', 'Error'

      # explicity notified system to apply the recommended action. System  ->
      # When auto-execute status of this advisor was set to 'Enabled', in which
      # case the system applied it. Possible values include: 'User', 'System'
