      # a Azure Spot VM/VMSS. This price is in US Dollars. <br><br> This price
      # will be compared with the current Azure Spot price for the VM size.
      # Also, the prices are compared at the time of create/update of Azure
      # Spot VM/VMSS and the operation will only succeed if  the maxPrice is
      # greater than the current Azure Spot price. <br><br> The maxPrice will

      # Spot price goes beyond the maxPrice after creation of VM/VMSS. <br><br>
      # Possible values are: <br><br> - Any decimal value greater than zero.
      # Example: 0.01538 <br><br> -1 – indicates default price to be up-to
      # on-demand. <br><br> You can set the maxPrice to -1 to indicate that the
      # Azure Spot VM/VMSS should not be evicted for price reasons. Also, the
      # default max price is -1 if it is not provided by you. <br><br>Minimum
